# implicit_return is allowable because it is idiomatic

# float_arithmetic is allowable because we are not developing on platforms

# as_conversions is allowable because we already check all other as-

# multiple_inherent_impl is allowable because we enforce that items - unless
# explicitly said otherwise - must be sorted alphabetically; in our case, it
# also makes sense that constructors are at the top of the impl-s for a type,
# so it makes sense to separate - at least - constructors from the rest of the
# impl-s.
